# HANK_Thesis
Code that solves and analyzes the HANK model of my 2020 thesis in economics. 

The file HANKSAM.ipy calibrates and solves the main HANK model and contains code that produces the main analyses through the paper. 
The files FigUtils.py and Utils2.py contains various utility functions that the main file uses. 

Many of the files (asymptotic.py, determinacy.py, het_block.py, jacobian.py, nonlinear.py, simple_block.py, solved_block-py, utils.py) comes from the SHADE-files (github: https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian/#sequence-space-jacobian) required to compute impulse responses using the sequence-space jacobian method.
